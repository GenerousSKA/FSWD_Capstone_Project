SMARTSTOCK: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM â€“ CAPSTONE PROJECT PROPOSAL

Project Title: SmartStock: Advanced Inventory Management System

Problem Statement
Managing inventory efficiently is crucial for businesses, but many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still rely on manual tracking or outdated systems, leading to stock discrepancies, lost sales, and operational inefficiencies.

Why is this problem significant?
â€¢	Manual inventory tracking is error-prone and time-consuming.
â€¢	Poor stock visibility can lead to overstocking or stockouts.
â€¢	Lack of real-time data makes decision-making difficult.
â€¢	Existing solutions may be too complex or expensive for small businesses.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly, cost-effective inventory management system that helps businesses track stock levels, manage suppliers, and generate reportsâ€”all in one place.

Overview of the Applicationâ€™s Functionality
Smart Stock: Is a full-stack web application that allows businesses to:
â€¢	Track inventory in real-time with stock level alerts.
â€¢	Manage suppliers and purchase orders.
â€¢	Generate reports (sales trends, stock valuation, etc.).
â€¢	Control user access with role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Staff).
â€¢	Scan barcodes for quick product lookup.

The system will have:
â€¢	A React.js frontend with a clean, responsive UI.
â€¢	A Node.js + Express backend with a MongoDB database.
â€¢	JWT authentication for secure login.
â€¢	RESTful APIs for data exchange.

4.	As a Supplier, I want to view purchase orders so that I know what to deliver.
5.	As a Business Owner, I want to generate sales reports so that I can analyze business performance.
