SMARTSTOCK: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – CAPSTONE PROJECT PROPOSAL

Project Title: SmartStock: Advanced Inventory Management System

Problem Statement
Managing inventory efficiently is crucial for businesses, but many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still rely on manual tracking or outdated systems, leading to stock discrepancies, lost sales, and operational inefficiencies.

Why is this problem significant?
•	Manual inventory tracking is error-prone and time-consuming.
•	Poor stock visibility can lead to overstocking or stockouts.
•	Lack of real-time data makes decision-making difficult.
•	Existing solutions may be too complex or expensive for small businesses.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly, cost-effective inventory management system that helps businesses track stock levels, manage suppliers, and generate reports—all in one place.

Overview of the Application’s Functionality
Smart Stock: Is a full-stack web application that allows businesses to:
•	Track inventory in real-time with stock level alerts.
•	Manage suppliers and purchase orders.
•	Generate reports (sales trends, stock valuation, etc.).
•	Control user access with role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Staff).
•	Scan barcodes for quick product lookup.

The system will have:
•	A React.js frontend with a clean, responsive UI.
•	A Node.js + Express backend with a MongoDB database.
•	JWT authentication for secure login.
•	RESTful APIs for data exchange.

Technology Stack
Category	Technologies
Frontend	React.js, TypeScript, Material-UI, React Query, Formik + Yup
Backend	Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT
DevOps	Git, GitHub, Vercel (Frontend Hosting), Render (Backend Hosting)
Testing	Jest (Unit Testing), Postman (API Testing)
Additional Tools	Barcode.js (for barcode generation), Chart.js (for analytics)

Features to be Implemented
Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
Product Management – Add, edit, delete, and categorize products.
Inventory Tracking – Real-time stock updates with low-stock alerts.
Supplier Management – Track supplier details and purchase orders.
User Authentication – Login, logout, and role-based access (Admin, Staff).
Basic Dashboard – Summary of stock levels and recent activities.

Additional Features (Future Enhancements)
🔹 Barcode/QR Scanning – Scan products using a webcam or mobile.
🔹 Advanced Reporting – Export data to Excel/PDF, sales analytics.
🔹 Multi-Warehouse Support – Track inventory across multiple locations.
🔹 Mobile App Integration – Sync with a React Native app.

User Stories
1.	As an Admin, I want to add new products to the inventory so that I can keep track of available stock.
2.	As a Store Manager, I want to receive low-stock alerts so that I can reorder products before they run out.
3.	As a Staff Member, I want to update stock levels after sales so that inventory records stay accurate.
4.	As a Supplier, I want to view purchase orders so that I know what to deliver.
5.	As a Business Owner, I want to generate sales reports so that I can analyze business performance.
