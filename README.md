SmartStock: Inventory Management System â€“ Capstone Project Proposal

Project Title: Smart Stock: Advanced Inventory Management System
Problem Statement
Managing inventory efficiently is crucial for businesses, but many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still rely on manual tracking or outdated systems, leading to stock discrepancies, lost sales, and operational inefficiencies.

Why is this problem significant?
â€¢	Manual inventory tracking is error-prone and time-consuming.
â€¢	Poor stock visibility can lead to overstocking or stockouts.
â€¢	Lack of real-time data makes decision-making difficult.
â€¢	Existing solutions may be too complex or expensive for small businesses.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly, cost-effective inventory management system that helps businesses track stock levels, manage suppliers, and generate reportsâ€”all in one place.
